I'm not exactly sure what this is yet, the idea is that there is multiple people logged into a tmux session, they all share a pseudo space, each person can make changes to their space and other people can see it (this is like done by git).

what is going on here,

so the user logs in and they are placed in an environment, in that environment they have access to a shell, were they can make files and scripts and stuff. the users are logged in to a tmux session. other people can see what they are doing. the other people will not have access to each individuals environment. but they can see the difference between them.
